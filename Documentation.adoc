== Inside the `archiso`

This section is aimed at providing help with the general installation of a customized Arch Linux from within an official Arch Linux image (`archiso`).

[NOTE]
====
As Arch Linux is a rolling release Linux distribution, it is advised, to have a working internet connection, in order to get the latest package upgrades and to install additional software, as the `archiso` only has very few packages available from cache.

Furthermore, one should bear in mind that depending on the version, or rather modification date, the guide may already be outdated.
If you encounter any problems along the way, you will either have to resolve the issue yourself, or utilize the great https://wiki.archlinux.org/[ArchWiki], or the https://bbs.archlinux.org/[Arch Linux forums].
====

<<<

=== ``Sy``ncing up `pacman`

First of all we need to sync up ``pacman``'s package repository, in order to be able to install packages

[source, console]
----
root@archiso ~ # pacman -Sy
----

[WARNING]
====
Using `pacman -Sy` should be sufficient, in order to be able to search for packages from within the `archiso`, without upgrading the system, but might break your system, if you use this command on an existing installation!

To be on the safe side, it is advised to always use `pacman -Syu` instead!

`pacstrap` uses the latest packages anyways.
====

<<<

==== Official repositories

After doing that, we can now install any software from the official repositories by issuing

[source, console]
----
root@archiso ~ # pacman -S <package_name>
----

where you would replace `<package_name>` with the actual package name.

If you don't know the exact package name, or if you just want to search for a keyword, for example `xfce` to list all packages having to do something with `xfce`, use

[source, console]
----
root@archiso ~ # pacman -Ss <keyword>
----

If you want to remove an installed package, just use

[source, console]
----
root@archiso ~ # pacman -Rsu <package_name>
----

[CAUTION]
====
If you have to force remove, which you should use *with extreme caution*, you can use

[source, console]
----
root@archiso ~ # pacman -Rdd <package_name>
----
====

<<<

==== `AUR`

If you want to install a package from the https://aur.archlinux.org/[`AUR`], I would proceed as follows

. `cd` into the dedicated directory, if you're using the `dotfiles` repo, which provides an `update.sh` script within that folder, to check every subfolder for updates
+
[source, console]
----
dustvoice@archiso ~ $ cd AUR
----

. Clone the package with `git`
+
[source, console]
----
dustvoice@archiso ~/AUR $ git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/pacman-git.git
----

. Switch to the package directory
+
[source, console]
----
dustvoice@archiso ~/AUR $ cd pacman-git
----

. Execute `makepkg`
+
[source, console]
----
dustvoice@archiso ~/AUR/pacman-git $ makepkg -si
----

. Delete all files created by `makepkg`, in order to easily see, if a package needs an update by using `git fetch --all` and `git status`
+
[source, console]
----
dustvoice@archiso ~/AUR/pacman-git $ git reset HEAD --hard
dustvoice@archiso ~/AUR/pacman-git $ git clean -fdx
----

[NOTE]
====
You might have to resolve any `AUR` dependencies, which can't be resolved with `pacman`.
====

[WARNING]
====
In order to install that `AUR` package, you *must* switch to your normal user, because `makepkg` doesn't run as root.
====

<<<

==== Software categories

In this guide, I'll be marking some headings according to which kind of software it uses.

There are three categories of software:

* `Console` software is intended to be used with either the native linux console, or with a terminal emulator
* `GUI` software is intended to be used in a graphical desktop environment
* `Hybrid` software can either be used within both a console and a graphical desktop environment (`networkmanager`), or there are packages available for both console and a graphical desktop environment (`pulseaudio` with `pulsemixer` for ^`console`^ and `pavucontrol` for ^`GUI`^

<<<

==== Software installation

In this guide, I'll be explicitly mark the packages installed in a specific section.

This enables you to

* clearly see what packages get installed / need to be installed in a specific section

* install packages before you start with the section in order to minimize waiting time

* not have to read through bloating lines like
+
[source, console]
----
dustvoice@DustArch ~
$ sudo pacman -S some-package
----

* not have to accidentally reinstall already installed packages

[NOTE]
====
The packages are always the recommended packages.

For further clarification for specific packages (e.g. `UEFI` specific packages), continue reading the section, as there is most certainly a explanation there.

Of course, you can adapt everything to your needs, especially in the <<additional-setup-packages>> step.
====

<<<

===== Example section

[cols="^.^m,^.^m", options="header"]
|===
2+|Software Packages

|core
|libutil-linux

|extra
|git

|community
|ardour cadence jsampler linuxsampler qsampler sample-package 

|AUR
|sbupdate
|===

You have to configure `sample-package` by editing `/etc/sample.conf`

./etc/sample.conf
[source, text]
----
Sample.text=useful
----

<<<

=== Formatting the drive

First you have to list all the available drives by issuing

[source, console]
----
root@archiso ~ # fdisk -l
----

[NOTE]
====
The output of `fdisk -l` is dependent on your system configuration.
====

In my case, the partition I want to install the root file system on is `/dev/sdb2`.
`/dev/sdb3` will be my `swap` partition.

[NOTE]
====
A `swap` size *twice the size of your RAM* is recommended by a lot of people.

With bigger RAM sizes available today, this isn't necessary anymore.
To be exact, every distribution has different recommendations for `swap` sizes.

Also `swap` size heavily depends on whether you want to be able to hibernate, etc.

You should make the `swap` size *at least your RAM size* and for RAM sizes over `4GB` and the wish to hibernate, at least one and a half your RAM size.
====

[IMPORTANT]
====
If you haven't yet partitioned your disk, please refer to the link:https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Partitioning[general partitioning tutorial] in the ArchWiki.
====

Now we need to format the partitions accordingly

[source, console]
----
root@archiso ~ # mkfs.ext4 /dev/sdb2
root@archiso ~ # mkswap /dev/sdb3
----

After doing that, we can turn on the `swap` and `mount` the root partition.

[source, console]
----
root@archiso ~ # swapon /dev/sdb3
root@archiso ~ # mount /dev/sdb2 /mnt
----

[NOTE]
====
If you have an additional `EFI system partition`, because of a _UEFI - GPT_ setup or e.g. an existing Windows installation, which we will assume to be located under `/dev/sda2` (`/dev/sda` is the disk of my Windows install), you'll have to `mount` this partition to the new systems `/boot` folder

[source, console]
----
root@archiso ~ # mkdir /mnt/boot
root@archiso ~ # mount /dev/sda2 /mnt/boot
----
====

<<<

=== Preparing the `chroot` environment

First it might make sense to edit `/etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist` to move the mirror(s) geographically closest to you to the top.

After that we can `pacstrap` the *minimum packages* needed.
We will install all other packages later on.

[cols="^.^m,^.^m", options="header"]
|===
2+|Software Packages

|core
|base linux linux-firmware
|===

[NOTE]
====
This is the actual command used in my case

[source, console]
----
root@archiso ~ # pacstrap /mnt base linux linux-firmware
----
====

After that generate an `fstab` using `genfstab`

[source, console]
----
root@archiso ~ # genfstab -U /mnt >> /mnt/etc/fstab
----

and you're ready to enter the `chroot` environment.

<<<

== Entering the `chroot`

[NOTE]
====
As we want to set up our new system, we need to have access to the different partitions, the internet, etc. which we wouldn't get by solely using `chroot`.

That's why we are using `arch-chroot`, provided by the `arch-install-scripts` package already shipped with the archiso.
This script takes care of all that stuff, so we can set up our system properly.
====

[source, console]
----
root@archiso ~ # arch-chroot /mnt
----

Et Voila! You successfully ``chroot``ed inside your new system and you'll be greeted by a `bash` prompt.

<<<

[#additional-startup-packages]
=== Installing additional packages

[cols="^.^m,^.^m", options="header"]
|===
2+|Software Packages

|core
|amd-ucode base-devel diffutils dmraid dnsmasq dosfstools efibootmgr exfat-utils grub iputils lvm2 openssh sudo usbutils

|extra

|community
|neovim os-prober
|===

[NOTE]
====
There are many command line text editors available, like `nano`, `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`, etc.

I'll be using `neovim`, though it shouldn't matter what editor you choose.
====

Make sure to enable the `NetworkManager.service` service, in order for the Internet connection to work upon booting into our fresh system later on.

[source, console]
----
[root@archiso /]# systemctl enable NetworkManager.service
----

With `polkit` installed, create a file `/etc/polkit-1/rules.d/50-org.freedesktop.NetworkManager.rules` to enable users of the `network` group to add new networks without the need of `sudo`.

./etc/polkit-1/rules.d/50-org.freedesktop.NetworkManager.rules
[source, text]
----
polkit.addRule(function(action, subject) {
    if (action.id.indexOf("org.freedesktop.NetworkManager.") == 0 && subject.isInGroup("network")) {
        return polkit.Result.YES;
    }
});
----

If you use `UEFI`, you'll also need the `efibootmgr`, in order to modify the `UEFI` entries.

<<<

=== Master of time

After that you have to set your timezone and update the system clock.

Generally speaking, you can find all the different timezones under `/usr/share/zoneinfo`.
In my case, my timezone resides under `/usr/share/zoneinfo/Europe/Berlin`.

To achieve the desired result, I want to symlink this to `/etc/localtime` and set the hardware clock.

[source, console]
----
[root@archiso /]# ln -s /usr/share/zoneinfo/Europe/Berlin /etc/localtime
[root@archiso /]# hwclock --systohc --utc
----

Now you can also enable time synchronization over network

[source, console]
----
[root@archiso /]# timedatectl set-timezone Europe/Berlin
[root@archiso /]# timedatectl set-ntp true
----

and check that everything is alright

[source, console]
----
[root@archiso /]# timedatectl status
----

<<<

=== Master of locales

Now you have to generate your locale information.

For that you have to edit `/etc/locale.gen` and uncomment the locales you want to enable.

[NOTE]
====
I recommend to always uncomment `en_US.UTF-8 UTF8`, even if you want to use another language primarily.
====

In my case I only uncommented the `en_US.UTF-8 UTF8` line

./etc/locale.gen
[source, text]
----
en_US.UTF-8 UTF8
----

After that you still have to actually generate the locales by issuing

[source, console]
----
[root@archiso /]# locale-gen
----

and set the locale

[source, console]
----
[root@archiso /]# localectl set-locale LANG="en_US.UTF-8"
----

After that we're done with this part.

<<<

=== Naming your machine

Now we can set the `hostname` and add `hosts` entries.

Apart from being mentioned in your command prompt, the `hostname` also serves the purpose of identifying, or naming your machine.
This enables you to see your PC in your router, etc.

<<<

==== `hostname`

To change the `hostname`, simply edit `/etc/hostname`, enter the desired name, then save and quit.

./etc/hostname
[source, text]
----
DustArch
----

<<<

==== `hosts`

Now we need to specify some `hosts` entries by editing `/etc/hosts`

./etc/hosts
[source, text]
----
# Static table lookup for hostnames.
# See hosts(5) for details.

127.0.0.1   localhost           .
::1         localhost           .
127.0.1.1   DustArch.localhost  DustArch
----

<<<

=== User setup

Now you should probably change the default `root` password and create a new non-``root`` user for yourself, as using your new system purely through the native `root` user is not recommended from a security standpoint.

<<<

==== Give `root` a password

To change the password for the current user (the `root` user) issue

[source, console]
----
[root@archiso /]# passwd
----

and choose a new password.

<<<

[#create-a-personal-user]
==== Create a personal user

[cols="^.^m,^.^m", options="header"]
|===
2+|Software Packages

|core
|sudo

|extra
|zsh
|===

We are going to create a new user and set the password, groups and shell for this user

[source, console]
----
[root@archiso /]# useradd -m -p "" -G "adm,audio,disk,floppy,kvm,log,lp,network,rfkill,scanner,storage,users,optical,power,wheel" -s /usr/bin/zsh dustvoice
[root@archiso /]# passwd dustvoice
----

We now have to allow the `wheel` group `sudo` access.

For that we edit `/etc/sudoers` and uncomment the `%wheel` line

./etc/sudoers
[source, text]
----
%wheel ALL=(ALL) ALL
----

You could also add a new line below the `root` line

./etc/sudoers
[source, text]
----
root ALL=(ALL) ALL
----

with your new username

./etc/sudoers
[source, text]
----
dustvoice ALL=(ALL) ALL
----

to solely grant the new user `sudo` privileges.

<<<

// TODO: Add section for EFISTUB

=== `grub`

[cols="^.^m,^.^m", options="header"]
|===
2+|Software Packages

|core
|efibootmgr grub
|===

Now onto installing the boot manager.
We will use `grub` in this guide.

First make sure, all the required packages are installed

[source, console]
----
[root@archiso /]# pacman -S grub dosfstools os-prober mtools
----

and if you want to use `UEFI`, also

[source, console]
----
[root@archiso /]# pacman -S efibootmgr
----

<<<

==== `BIOS`

If you chose the `BIOS - MBR` variation, you'll have to *do nothing special*

If you chose the `BIOS - GPT` variation, you'll have to *have a `+1M` boot partition* created with the partition type set to `BIOS boot`.

In both cases you'll have to *run the following comman* now

[source, console]
----
[root@archiso /]# grub-install --target=i386-pc /dev/sdb
----

[NOTE]
====
It should obvious that you would need to replace `/dev/sdb` with the disk you actually want to use.
Note however that you have to specify a *disk* and *not a partition*, so *no number*.
====

<<<

==== `UEFI`

If you chose the `UEFI - GPT` variation, you'll have to *have the `EFI System Partition` mounted* at `/boot` (where `/dev/sda2` is the partition holding said `EFI System Partition` in my particular setup)

Now *install `grub` to the `EFI System Partition`*

[source, console]
----
[root@archiso /]# grub-install --target=x86_64-efi --efi-directory=/boot --bootloader-id=grub --recheck
----

[IMPORTANT]
====
If you've planned on dual booting arch with Windows and therefore reused the `EFI System Partition` created by Windows, you might not be able to boot to grub just yet.

In this case, boot into Windows, open a `cmd` window as Administrator and type in

[source, console]
----
bcdedit /set {bootmgr} path \EFI\grub\grubx64.efi
----

To make sure that the path is correct, you can use

[source, console]
----
[root@archiso /]# ls /boot/EFI/grub
----

under Linux to make sure, that the `grubx64.efi` file is really there.
====

<<<

==== `grub` config

In all cases, you now have to create the main `grub.cfg` configuration file.

But before we actually generate it, we'll make some changes to the default `grub` settings, which the `grub.cfg` will be generated from.

<<<

===== Adjust the timeout

First of all, I want my `grub` menu to wait indefinitely for my command to boot an OS.

./etc/default/grub
[source, text]
----
GRUB_TIMEOUT=-1
----

[NOTE]
====
I decided on this, because I'm dual booting with Windows and after Windows updates itself, I don't want to accidentally boot into my Arch Linux, just because I wasn't quick enough to select the Windows Boot Loader from the `grub` menu.

Of course you can set this parameter to whatever you want.

Another way of achieving what I described, would be to make `grub` remember the last selection.

./etc/default/grub
[source, text]
----
GRUB_TIMEOUT=5
GRUB_DEFAULT=saved
GRUB_SAVEDEFAULT="true"
----
====

<<<

===== Enable the recovery

After that I also want the recovery option showing up, which means that besides the standard and fallback images, also the recovery one would show up.

./etc/default/grub
[source, text]
----
GRUB_DISABLE_RECOVERY=false
----

<<<

===== NVIDIA fix

Now, as I'm using the binary NVIDIA driver for my graphics card, I also want to make sure, to revert `grub` back to text mode, after I select a boot entry, in order for the NVIDIA driver to work properly.
You might not need this

./etc/default/grub
[source, text]
----
GRUB_GFXPAYLOAD_LINUX=text
----

<<<

===== Add power options

I also want to add two new menu entries, to enable me to shut down the PC, or reboot it, right from the `grub` menu.

./etc/grub.d/40-custom
[source, text]
----
menuentry '=> Shutdown' {
    halt
}

menuentry '=> Reboot' {
    reboot
}
----

<<<

===== Installing `memtest`

As I want all possible options to possibly troubleshoot my PC right there in my `grub` menu,  without the need to boot into a live OS, I also want to have a memory tester there.

<<<

====== `BIOS`

[cols="^.^m,^.^m", options="header"]
|===
2+|Software Packages

|extra
|memtest86+
|===

For a `BIOS` setup, you'll simply need to install the `memtest86+` package, with no further configuration.

<<<

====== `UEFI`

[cols="^.^m,^.^m", options="header"]
|===
2+|Software Packages

|AUR
|memtest86-efi
|===

For a `UEFI` setup, you'll first need to install the package and then tell ``memtest86-efi``^`AUR`^ how to install itself

[source, console]
----
[root@archiso /]# memtest86-efi -i
----

Now select option 3, to install it as a `grub2` menu item.

<<<

===== Enabling hibernation

In order to use the hibernation feature, you'll have to make sure that your `swap` partition/file is at least the size of your RAM.

After that we need to perform two tasks

. Add the `resume` hook to `/etc/mkinitcpio.conf`, before `fsck` and definetely after `block`
+
./etc/mkinitcpio.conf
[source, text]
----
HOOKS=(base udev autodetect modconf block filesystems keyboard resume fsck)
----
. Add the `resume` kernel parameter to `/etc/default/grub`, containing my `swap` partition `UUID`, in my case
+
./etc/default/grub
[source, console]
----
GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="loglevel=3 quiet resume=UUID=097c6f11-f246-40eb-a702-ba83c92654f2"
----

After that we have to run

[source, console]
----
[root@archiso /]# mkinitcpio -p linux
----

[NOTE]
====
If you have to change anything, like the `swap` partition `UUID`, inside the `grub` configuration files, you'll always have to rerun `grub-mkconfig` as explained in <<generating-the-grub-config>>.
====

[#generating-the-grub-config]
===== Generating the `grub` config

Now we can finally generate our `grub.cfg`

[source, console]
----
[root@archiso /]# grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg
----

Now you're good to boot into your new system.

<<<

=== Secure Boot

<<<

==== `shim`

[WARNING]
====
This is a way of handling secure boot that aims at just making everything work!

It is not the way Secure Boot was intended to be used and you might as well disable it.

If you need Secure Boot to be enabled, e.g. for Windows, but you couldn't care less for the security it could bring to your device, use this method.

If you want to actually make use of the Secure Boot feature, read <<manual-secure-boot-setup>>.
====

[cols="^.^m,^.^m", options="header"]
|===
2+|Software Packages

|AUR
|shim-signed
|===

I know I told you that you're now good to boot into your new system.
That is only correct, if you're *not* using Secure Boot.

You can either proceed by disabling Secure Boot in your firmware settings, or by using `shim` as kind of a pre-bootloader, as well as signing your bootloader (`grub`) and your kernel.

If you decided on using Secure Boot, you will first have to install the package.

Now we just need to copy `shimx64.efi`, as well as `mmx64.efi` to our `EFI System Partition`

[source, console]
----
[root@archiso /]# cp /usr/share/shim-signed/shimx64.efi /boot/EFI/grub/
[root@archiso /]# cp /usr/share/shim-signed/mmx64.efi /boot/EFI/grub/
----

[NOTE]
====
If you have to use `bcdedit` from within Windows, as explained previously, you need to adapt the command accordingly

[source, text]
----
bcdedit /set {bootmgr} path \EFI\grub\shimx64.efi
----
====

Now you will be greeted by `MokManager` everytime you update your bootloader or kernel.

Just choose `Enroll hash from disk` and enroll your bootloader (`grubx64.efi`) and kernel (`vmlinuz-linux`).

Reboot and your system should fire up just fine.

<<<

[#manual-secure-boot-setup]
==== The manual way

// TODO: Describe manual secure boot setup, mention that grub is trash for this as it ignores if the kernel is signed or not, use EFISTUB, mention memtest setup with this way and sbupdate

<<<

== Inside the `DustArch`

This section helps at setting up the customized system from within an installed system.

This section mainly provides aid with the basic set up tasks, like networking, dotfiles, etc.

[NOTE]
====
Not everything in this section is mandatory.

This section is rather a guideline, because it is easy to forget some steps needed, for example `jack` for audio production, that only become apparent, when they're needed.

It is furthermore the responsibility of the reader to decide which steps to skip and which need further research.
As I mentioned, this is only a guide and not the answer to everything.
====

<<<

=== Someone there?

First we have to check if the network interfaces are set up properly.

To view the network interfaces with all their properties, we can issue

[source, text]
----
DustArch% ip link
----

To make sure that you have a working _Internet_ connection, issue

[source, text]
----
DustArch% ping archlinux.org
----

Everything should run smoothly if you have a wired connection.

If there is no connection and you're indeed using a wired connection, try restarting the `NetworkManager` service

[source, text]
----
DustArch% sudo systemctl restart NetworkManager.service
----

and then try ``ping``ing again.

If you're trying to utilize a Wi-Fi connection, use `nmcli`, the ``NetworkManager``'s command line tool, or `nmtui`, the `NetworkManager` terminal user interface, to connect to a Wi-Fi network.

[NOTE]
====
I never got `nmtui` to behave like I wanted it to, in my particular case at least, which is the reason why I use `nmcli` or the GUI tools.
====

First make sure, the scanning of nearby Wi-Fi networks is enabled for your Wi-Fi device

[source, text]
----
DustArch% nmcli radio
----

and if not, enable it

[source, text]
----
DustArch% nmcli radio wifi on
----

Now make sure your Wi-Fi interface appears under

[source, text]
----
DustArch% nmcli device
----

Rescan for available networks

[source, text]
----
DustArch% nmcli device wifi rescan
----

and list all found networks

[source, text]
----
DustArch% nmcli device wifi list
----

After that connect to the network

[source, text]
----
DustArch% nmcli device wifi connect --ask
----

Now try ``ping``ing again.

<<<

=== Update and upgrade

After making sure that you have a working Internet connection, you can then proceed to update and upgrade all installed packages by issuing

[source, text]
----
DustArch% sudo pacman -Syu
----

<<<

=== Enabling the `multilib` repository

In order to make 32-bit packages available to `pacman`, we'll need to enable the `multilib` repository in `/etc/pacman.conf` first.
Simply uncomment

./etc/pacman.conf
[source, text]
----
[multilib]
Include = /etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist
----

and update ``pacman``'s package repositories afterwards

[source, text]
----
DustArch% sudo pacman -Syu
----

<<<

=== `zsh` for president

Of course you can use any shell you want.
In my case I'll be using the `zsh` shell.

[NOTE]
====
I am using `zsh` because of its auto completion functionality and extensibility, as well as a brilliant `vim` like navigation implementation through a plugin, though that might not be what you're looking for.
====

We already set the correct shell for the `dustvoice` user in the <<create-a-personal-user>> step, but I want to use `zsh` for the `root` user too, so I'll have to change ``root``'s default shell to it.

[source, text]
----
DustArch% sudo chsh -s /usr/bin/zsh root
----

Don't worry about the looks by the way, we're gonna change all that in just a second.

After that you'll still have to setup `gnupg` correctly.
In my case I have my private keys stored on a smartcard.

To use it, I'll have to install the listed packages and then enable and start the `pcscd` service

[source, text]

[#setup-home]
=== Setting up a `home` environment

In this step we're going to setup a home environment for both the `root` and my personal `dustvoice` user.

[NOTE]
====
In my case these 2 home environments are mostly equivalent, which is why I'll execute the following commands as the `dustvoice` user first and then switch to the `root` user and repeat the same commands.

I decided on this, as I want to edit files with elevated permissions and still have the same editor style and functions/plugins.

Note that this comes with some drawbacks.
For example, if I change a configuration for my `dustvoice` user, I would have to regularly update it for the `root` user too.
This bears the problem, that I have to register my smartcard for the root user.
This in turn is problematic, cause the `gpg-agent` used for `ssh` authentication, doesn't behave well when used within a `su` or `sudo -i` session.
So in order to update ``root``'s config files I would either need to symlink everything, which I won't do, or I'll need to login as the `root` user now and then, to update everything.
====

[NOTE]
====
In my case, I want to access all my `git` repositories with my `gpg` key on my smartcard.
For that I have to configure the `gpg-agent` with some configuration files that reside in a `git` repository.
This means I will have to reside to using the `https` URL of the repository first and later changing the URL either in the corresponding `.git/config` file, or by issuing the appropriate command.
====

<<<

==== Use `dotfiles` for a base config

To provide myself with a base configuration, which I can then extend, I have created a `dotfiles` repository, which contains all kinds of configurations.

The special thing about this `dotfiles` repository is that it *is* my home folder.
By using a curated `.gitignore` file, I'm able to only include the configuration files I want to keep between installs into the repository and ignore everything else.

To achieve this very specific setup, I have to turn my home directory into said `dotfiles` repository first

[source, text]
----
DustArch% git init
DustArch% git remote add origin https://git.dustvoice.de/DustVoice/dotfiles.git
DustArch% git fetch
DustArch% git reset origin/master --hard
DustArch% git branch --set-upstream-to=origin/master master
----

Now I can issue any `git` command in my `~` directory, because it now is a `git` repository.

<<<

==== Set up `gpg`

As I wanted to keep my `dotfiles` repository as modular as possible, I utilize ``git``'s `submodule` feature.
Furthermore I want to use my `nvim` repository, which contains all my configurations and plugins for `neovim`, on Windows, but without all the Linux specific configuration files.
I am also using the `Pass` repository on my Android phone and Windows PC, where I only need this repository without the other Linux configuration files.

Before we'll be able to update the ``submodule``s (`nvim` config files and ``pass``word-store) though, we will have to setup our `gpg` key as an `ssh` key, as I use it to authenticate

[source, console]
----
dustvoice@DustArch ~
$ chmod 700 .gnupg
dustvoice@DustArch ~
$ gpg --card-status
dustvoice@DustArch ~
$ gpg --card-edit

----
(insert) gpg/card> fetch
(insert) gpg/card> q
----

[source, console]
----
dustvoice@DustArch ~
$ gpg-connect-agent updatestartuptty /bye
----

[NOTE]
====
You would have to adapt the `keygrip` present in the `~/.gnupg/sshcontrol` file to your specific `keygrip`, retrieved with `gpg -K --with-keygrip`.
====

Now, as mentioned before, I'll switch to using `ssh` for authentication, rather than `https`

[source, console]
----
dustvoice@DustArch ~
$ git remote set-url origin git@git.dustvoice.de:DustVoice/dotfiles.git
----

As the best method to both make `zsh` recognize all the configuration changes, as well as the `gpg-agent` behave properly, is to re-login, we'll do just that

[source, console]
----
dustvoice@DustArch ~
$ exit
----

[WARNING]
====
It is very important to note, that I mean *a real re-login*.

That means that if you've used `ssh` to log into your machine, it probably won't be sufficient to login into a new `ssh` session.
You'll probably need to restart the machine completely.
====

<<<

==== `gpg-agent` forwarding

Now there is only one thing left to do, in order to make the `gpg` setup complete: `gpg-agent` forwarding over `ssh`.
This is very important for me, as I want to use my smartcard on my development server too, which requires me, to forward/tunnel my `gpg-agent` to my remote machine.

First of all, I want to setup a config file for `ssh`, as I don't want to pass all parameters manually to ssh every time.

.++~++/.ssh/config
[source, text]
----
Host <connection name>
    HostName <remote address>
    ForwardAgent yes
    ForwardX11 yes
    RemoteForward <remote agent-socket> <local agent-extra-socket>
    RemoteForward <remote agent-ssh-socket> <local agent-ssh-socket>
----

[NOTE]
====
You would of course, need to adapt the content in between the `<` and `>` brackets.

To get the paths needed as parameters for `RemoteForward`, issue

[source, console]
----
dustvoice@DustArch ~
$ gpgconf --list-dirs
----
====

====
An example for a valid `~/.ssh/config` would be

.++~++/.ssh/config
[source, text]
----
Host archserver
    HostName pc.dustvoice.de
    ForwardAgent yes
    ForwardX11 yes
    RemoteForward /run/user/1000/gnupg/S.gpg-agent /run/user/1000/gnupg/S.gpg-agent.extra
    RemoteForward /run/user/1000/gnupg/S.gpg-agent.ssh /run/user/1000/gnupg/S.gpg-agent.ssh
----
====

Now you'll still need to enable some settings on the remote machine(s).

./etc/ssh/sshd_config
[source, text]
----
StreamLocalBindUnlink yes
AllowAgentForwarding yes
X11Forwarding yes
----

Now just restart your remote machine(s) and you're ready to go.

<<<

==== Back to your ``root``s

As mentioned before, you would now switch to the `root` user, either by logging in as `root`, or by using

[source, console]
----
dustvoice@DustArch ~
$ sudo -iu root
----

Now go back to <<setup-home>> to repeat all commands for the `root` user.

[WARNING]
====
A native login would be better compared to `sudo -iu root`, as there could be some complications, like already running `gpg-agent` instances, etc., which you would need to manually resolve, when using `sudo -iu root`.

|AUR
|nvidia-xrun
|===

If you're using an NVIDIA graphics card, you might want to use ``nvidia-xrun``^`AUR`^ instead of `startx`.
This has the advantage, of the `nvidia` kernel modules, as well as the `nouveau` ones not loaded at boot time, thus saving power.
``nvidia-xrun``^`AUR`^ will then load the correct kernel modules and run the `.nvidia-xinitrc` script in your home directory (for more file locations look into the documentation for ``nvidia-xrun``^`AUR`^).

[IMPORTANT]
====
At the time of writing, ``nvidia-xrun``^`AUR`^ needs `sudo` permissions before executing its task.
====

|AUR
|nvidia-xrun-pm
|===

If your hardware doesn't support `bbswitch`, you would need to use ``nvidia-xrun-pm``^`AUR`^ instead.
====

Now we need to blacklist *both `nouveau` and `nvidia`* kernel modules.

To do that, we first have to find out, where our active `modprobe.d` directory is located.
There are 2 possible locations, generally speaking: `/etc/modprobe.d` and `/usr/lib/modprobe.d`.
In my case it was the latter, which I could tell, because this directory already had files in it.

Now I'll create a new file named `nvidia-xrun.conf` and write the following into it

./usr/lib/modprobe.d/nvidia-xrun.conf
[source, text, linenums]
----
blacklist nvidia
blacklist nvidia-drm
blacklist nvidia-modeset
blacklist nvidia-uvm
blacklist nouveau
----

With this config in place,

[source, console]
----
dustvoice@DustArch ~
$ lsmod | grep nvidia
----

and

[source, console]
----
dustvoice@DustArch ~
$ lsmod | grep nouveau
----

should return no output.
Else you might have to place some additional entries into the file.

[NOTE]
====
Of course, you'll need to reboot, after blacklisting the modules and before issuing the 2 commands mentioned.
====

[NOTE]
====
If you installed `nvidia-xrun-pm` instead of `nvidia-xrun` and `bbswitch`, you might want to also enable the `nvidia-xrun-pm` service

$ sudo systemctl enable nvidia-xrun-pm.service
----
====

[NOTE]
====
The required `.nvidia-xinitrc` file, mentioned previously, should already be provided in the `dotfiles` repository.

Probably the first thing you'll want to set up is a session locker, which locks your ``X``-session after resuming from sleep, hibernation, etc.
It then requires you to input your password again, so no unauthorized user can access you machine.

I'll use `xss-lock` to hook into the necessary `systemd` events and `i3lock` as my locker.

[NOTE]

I have placed the required command to start `xss-lock` with the right parameters inside my `i3` configuration file.

== Upgrading the system

You're probably wondering why this gets a dedicated section.

You'll probably think that it would be just a matter of issuing

[source, console]
----
dustvoice@DustArch ~
$ sudo pacman -Syu
----

That's both true and false.

You have to make sure, *that your boot partition is mounted at `/boot`* in order for everything to upgrade correctly.
That's because the moment you upgrade the `linux` package without having the correct partition mounted at `/boot`, your system won't boot.
You also might have to do `grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg` after you install a different kernel image.

If your system *indeed doesn't boot* and *boots to a recovery console*, then double check that the issue really is the not perfectly executed kernel update by issuing

[source, console]
----
root@DustArch ~
$ uname -a
----

and

[source, console]
----
root@DustArch ~
$ pacman -Q linux
----

*The version of these two packages should be exactly the same!*

If it isn't there is an easy fix for it.

<<<

=== Fixing a faulty kernel upgrade

First off we need to restore the old `linux` package.

For that note the version number of

[source, console]
----
root@DustArch ~
$ uname -a
----

Now we'll make sure first that nothing is mounted at `/boot`, because the process will likely create some unwanted files.
The process will also create a new `/boot` folder, which we're going to delete afterwards.

[source, console]
----
root@DustArch ~
$ umount /boot
----

Now `cd` into ``pacman``'s package cache

[source, console]
----
root@DustArch ~
$ cd /var/cache/pacman/pkg
----

There should be a file located named something like `linux-<version>.pkg.tar.xz`, where `<version>` would be somewhat equivalent to the previously noted version number

Now downgrade the `linux` package

[source, console]
----
root@DustArch ~
$ pacman -U linux-<version>.pkg.tar.xz
----

After that remove the possibly created `/boot` directory

[source, console]
----
root@DustArch ~
$ rm -rf /boot
root@DustArch ~
$ mkdir /boot
----

Now reboot and `mount` the `boot` partition, in my case an `EFI System Partition`.

Now simply rerun

[source, console]
----
dustvoice@DustArch ~
$ sudo pacman -Syu
----

and you should be fine now.

[NOTE]
====
Consider setting up an `fstab` entry for the `boot` partition, in order to avoid such dilemma in the future.

See <<setting-up-fstab>> for more.
